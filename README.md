This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_27/) explores the various density and distance-based anomaly detection algorithms for estimating outlier scores. Methods applied in the analysis to identify abnormal points with patterns significantly deviating away from the remaining data included the Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor, Distance-Based Outlier Detection, Influenced Outlierness, Kernel-Density Estimation Outlier Score, Aggregated K-Nearest Neighbors Distance, In-Degree for Observations in a K-Nearest Neighbors Graph, Sum of Distance to K-Nearest Neighbors, Local Density Factor, Local Distance-Based Outlier Factor, Local Correlation Integral, Local Outlier Factor and Natural Outlier Factor algorithms. Using an independent label indicating the valid and outlying points from the data, the different anomaly-detection algorithms were evaluated based on their capability to effectively discriminate both data categories using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) metric.
